\section*{Acknowledgements}
There are too many people to name I have depended on throughout the completion of this MSc, but I shall try to name but a few.
\\
\\
First and foremost I must thank Alexandra Din, who showed such incredible love, support and selflessness throughout my postgrad.
\\
\\
To my parents, without whom I could never have had such a tremendous opportunity at personal growth.
\\
\\
To Soofi Din, for being the greatest friend and conversationalist I have ever known.  And to Amanda Din, for always pushing me to do my best and keeping me on my toes.
\\
\\
Quite especially to Jeremy Howard of fast.ai. Without his deep learning MOOC, I could never have gained the requisite knowledge to understand and build deep neural networks.
\\
\\
To my classmates turned friends at The University of Nottingham for sharing in your passion for this great field of Computer Science.
\\
\\
To The University of Pennsylvania's Linguistic Data Consortium for their generous scholarship for the Annotated English Gigaword Corpus so paramount to the implementation and success of this project.
\\
\\
To my Supervisor, Dr. Natasa Milic-Frayling, for her much appreciated guidance and encouragement.
\\
\\
And to all the faculty of The University of Nottingham whom had the great misfortune have having to put up with me.
