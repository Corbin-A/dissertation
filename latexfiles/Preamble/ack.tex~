  \Large{Acknowledgements}
  There are some many people I have depended on throughout the completion of this MSc.
  
  First and foremost, Alexandra Din, who put up with all the late nights, the stress, and showed such incredible selflessness.

  To my parents, without whom I could never have had such a tremendous opportunity at personal growth.

  To Soofi Din, for being the greatest friend and conversationalist I have ever know.  And to Amanda Din, for always pushing me to do my best and keeping me on my toes.

  To my classmates turned friends at the University of Nottingham for sharing in your passion for this great field of Computer Science.

  And to all the faculty whom had the great disfortune have having to put up with me.
